# Compiler vs Interpreter

**Compiler**

The compiler scans the entire source code and translates the whole of it into machine code at once.

The code you write is usually converted into another form that a computer knows how to run. This process is called compilation, and the period this happens is called "**compile time.**"

After compilation, the program is launched, and the period it's running is called "**runtime.**"

Types of programming languages that use compilers are

C

C++

Rust

Haskell

Erlang



**Interpreters**

The Interpreter translates just one statement of the source code at a time into machine code at runtime.

Type of programming languages that use interpreters are

Python

PHP

Perl

Ruby



**What about JAVA?**

The JAVA is a combination of both.

It first compiles the source code into byte code and uses Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to interpret the Java byte code.
