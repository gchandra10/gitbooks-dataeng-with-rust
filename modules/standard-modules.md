# Standard Modules

Like python/java/c/c++ Rust has standard modules which can be used for standard functionality.

Example:

The `std::io` the module contains a number of common things youâ€™ll need when doing input and output.

Similarly when working with Files&#x20;

```
use std::fs::File;
```

can be used.
